clicks on ride a wave with friends first
guest login for people who don't have fs account
why fs? fb better?

go to friends list button cut off
tries to click on names like i did
confused about 'goes to friends list'
confused about what friends do
tries to select more than one button on the i'm feeling page
what does notification mean?
too few details on wave detail page
tries to click on phone number
tries to click on 'hey there'
no profile - no place to see what you are doing/what you have done - see history, current wave, hot waves
why are the friends listed there? great looking page though
order of friend circle screens makes it seems as though now you have to do something

more back buttons?
